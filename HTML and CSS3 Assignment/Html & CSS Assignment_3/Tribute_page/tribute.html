            <h3>10 Things About Dr Abdul Kalam:</h3>
            <ol class="list">
                <li>He was born at Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu to an impoverished family of seven whose sole source of income was a boat. To contribute to their dwindling finances, he started selling newspapers at a very young age.</li>
                <li>Before becoming the president, Kalam, acknowledged as the driving force behind India's quest for cutting-edge defence technologies, used to stay in a one-room flat.</li>
                <li>Kalam missed an opportunity to become a fighter pilot for the Indian Air force. His dreams were shattered when he was ranked 9th when there were only 8 openings.</li>

                <li>Kalam’s visit to Switzerland is commemorated as Science Day in the country. This declaration was made in his honour by the Swiss government after the sad demise of this great personality.</li>
                <li>Kalam wrote a great deal of poetry in Tamil, and was very fond of playing the stringed instrument Veena. He has also published several books such as Wings of Fire, Ignited Minds, Inspiring Thoughts, and Turning Points among others.</li>
                <li>Researchers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), NASA, discovered a new radiation-resistant bacteria in 2017 and named it ‘Solibacillus Kalamii’ to honour the late President.</li>
                <li>Kalam also made significant contributions to the nuclear capabilities of India. The Pokhran -2 nuclear tests (in 1998) were successful thanks to his organizational and technical support.</li>
