Atlanta Population

q1) use db.zipcodes.find() to filter results to only the results where city is ATLANTA and state is GA.
Ans : db.zipcodes.find({city:"ATLANTA", state:"GA"});

q2) use db.zipcodes.aggregate with $match to do the same as above.
Ans : db.zipcodes.aggregate([
	{$match:{city:"ATLANTA", state:"GA"}}
	]);

q3) use $group to count the number of zip codes in Atlanta.
Ans : db.zipcodes.aggregate([
       {$match:{city:"ATLANTA"}},
       {"$group" : {_id:"$city", count:{$sum:1}}}
      ]);

q4) use $group to find the total population in Atlanta.
Ans : db.zipcodes.aggregate([
		{$group: {_id: {city:"ATLANTA"}, total:{$sum:"$pop"}}}
	]);

Population by states

q1) use aggregate to calculate the total population for each state
Ans : db.zipcodes.aggregate([
		{$group: {_id: "$state", total:{$sum:"$pop"}}}
	]);

q2) sort the results by population, highest first
Ans : db.zipcodes.aggregate([
		{$group: {_id: "$state", total:{$sum:"$pop"}}},
		{$sort:{"total":-1}}
	]);

q3) limit the results to just the first 3 results. What are the top 3 states in population?
Ans : db.zipcodes.aggregate([
		{$group: {_id: "$state", total:{$sum:"$pop"}}},
		{$sort:{"total":-1}},
		{$limit: 3}
	]);


populations by city

q1) use aggregate to calculate the total population for each city (you have to use city/state combination). You can use a combination for the _id of the $group: { city: '$city', state: '$state' }
Ans : db.zipcodes.aggregate([
		{$group: {_id:{city:"$city",state:"$state"}, total:{$sum:"$pop"}}}
	]);	

q2) sort the results by population, highest first
Ans : db.zipcodes.aggregate([
		{$group: {_id:{city:"$city",state:"$state"}, total:{$sum:"$pop"}}},
		{$sort:{"total":-1}}
	]);

q3) limit the results to just the first 3 results. What are the top 3 cities in population?
Ans : db.zipcodes.aggregate([
	{$group: {_id: {city:"$city",state:"$state"}, total:{$sum:"$pop"}}},
	{$sort:{"total":-1}},
	{$limit: 3}
	]);

q4) What are the top 3 cities in population in Texas?
Ans : db.zipcodes.aggregate([
	{$group: {_id: {city:"$city",state:"TX"}, total:{$sum:"$pop"}}},
	{$sort:{"total":-1}},
	{$limit: 3}
	]);


bonus:
q1) Write a query to get the average city population for each state.
Ans : db.zipcodes.aggregate([
		{$group:{_id:"$state", average:{$avg:"$pop"}}}
	]);

q1) What are the top 3 states in terms of average city population?
Ans : db.zipcodes.aggregate([
	{$group: {_id: {city:"$city",state:"$state"}, average:{$avg:"$pop"}}},
	{$sort:{"average":-1}},
	{$limit: 3}
	]);
